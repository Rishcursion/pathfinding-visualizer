# Pathfinding Visualization:
The objective of this project is to apply what i have learned in theory about pathfinding algorithms and demonstrate how they work visually. 
The application will be written in SvelteKit for the UI and TypeScript for executing the algorithms.
# Algorithms To Be Demonstrated: 
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Best First Search
- Dijkstra's Algorithm 
- A* Algorithm (With Simple Heuristics)
- Hill Climb Search (With Simple Heuristics)
